We invite submissions in the area of offline RL, towards answering questions including, but not limited to:
<ul>
<li> open problems in offline RL.
<li> theoretical understanding of offline (or batch RL) methods
<li> offline model selection, off-policy evaluation and theoretical limitations
<li> properties of supervision needed to guarantee the success of offline RL methods
<li> practical applications of offline RL and how these guide novel problem formulations
<li> connections with related (e.g., causal inference, optimization, self-supervised learning, uncertainty)
<li> relationship and integration with the conventional online RL paradigms
<li> evaluation protocols, benchmarks and datasets
  </ul>
For a more detailed summary of questions we are particularly excited about, please visit the <a href="index.html">front page</a>. We welcome theoretical and/or empirical contributions. 
We are especially excited about work at the synergy of several of these questions.

<p> We shall accept submissions of up to 8 pages of content (with no limit on references and supplementary material) that have not been previously accepted at an archival venue (such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR). While up to 8 pages of content is allowed, we strongly encourage authors to limit their submission to 4-6 pages, to ensure higher quality reviewer feedback. Papers can utilize any style file they want (for e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) and should be anonymized for double blind review. </p>

<p> <b> Evaluation Criteria</b>: We shall evaluate papers on clarity, potential impact, significance, and novelty of the proposed ideas. We are happy to accept works-in-progress to encourage discussion at the workshop. All accepted papers will be advertised on the workshop website and are non-archival. </p>
