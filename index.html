        <p>
        Cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long-standing
        shared history. Early research in AI was inspired by human intelligence
        and shaped by cognitive scientists (e.g., Elman, 1990; Rumelhart and McClelland,
        1986).  At the same time, efforts in understanding human learning and
        processing used methods and data borrowed from AI to build cognitive
        models that mimicked human cognition (e.g., Anderson, 1975; Tenenbaum et al., 2006;
        Lieder & Griffiths, 2017; Dupoux, 2018). 
        In the last five years the field of AI has grown rapidly due to the success of
        large-scale deep learning models in a variety of applications (such as
        speech recognition and image classification).  Interestingly,
        algorithms and architectures in these models are often loosely inspired
        by natural forms of cognition (such as convolutional architectures and
        experience replay; e.g. Hassabis et al., 2017).  
        In turn, the improvement of these algorithms and architectures enabled more advanced
        models of human cognition that can replicate, and therefore enlighten
        our understanding of, human behavior (Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016; Fan et al., 2018;
        Banino et al., 2018; Bourgin et al., 2019).
          Empirical data from cognitive psychology has also recently played an
        important role in measuring how current AI systems differ from humans
        and in identifying their failure modes (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Lake
        et al., 2017; Gopnik, 2017; Nematzadeh et al., 2018; Peterson et al., 2019;
        Hamrick, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>  
        The recent advancements in AI confirm the success of a multidisciplinary approach inspired by
        human cognition. However, the large body of literature supporting each field makes it more difficult
        for researchers to engage in multidisciplinary research without collaborating. Yet, outside
        domain-specific subfields, there are few forums that enable researchers in AI to actually connect
        with people from the cognitive sciences and form such collaborations. Our workshop aims to inspire
        connections between AI and cognitive science across a broad set of topics, including perception,
        language, reinforcement learning, planning, human-robot interaction, animal cognition, child development,
        and reasoning.

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>We are sourcing short, four-page papers from cognitive science,
        neuroscience, and AI across two tracks. </p>

        <p> The <b>Research track</b> will highlight advances at the
        intersection of AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience. We
        welcome submissions on: </p>

        <p>
        <ul>

          <li>How research in AI could inform research in cognitive science,</li>
          <li>Survey papers which summarize one area of research in AI or cognitive science for researchers in the other field, or</li>
          <li>Works which otherwise propose a longer-term idea or position about the intersection of cognitive science and AI.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>We particularly encourage submissions from students from groups that are underrepresented at machine learning conferences</b>, including: gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and institution. We are pleased to be able to offer a limited number of travel grants to student presenters from these groups; if you would like to apply for financial assistance, please indicate this when submitting your paper.</p>

        <p> Submission Policy: </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Submissions should be a maximum of four pages, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. </li>
          <li> Papers should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. </li>
          <li>Papers should use the <a href='https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/blob/master/archive/iclr2020.zip'>ICLR style file</a>.</li>
          <li> Dual submission policy: we welcome submissions that have been published or are currently under review at other venues, including both full conference papers and workshops. However, all submissions should be shortened to four pages. </li>
          <li>Evaluation criteria: Papers will be reviewed for topicality, clarity, correctness, and novelty; however, we welcome submissions which are still work-in-progress. Papers which are longer than four pages, clearly off-topic, or not anonymized will be rejected without review.</li>
          <li>Submission site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BAICS2020/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BAICS2020/</a></li>
