      <td><b><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/index.html">Emma Brunskill</a></b> is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at 
        Stanford University. Her goal is to create AI systems that learn from few samples to robustly make good decisions, motivated by our 
        applications to healthcare and education. 
<!-- Her work has been honored by early faculty career awards (NSF, Office of Naval Research, Microsoft Research (1 of 7 worldwide)) and several best research paper nominations (CHI, EDMx3) and awards (UAI, RLDM). -->

She studies how our commonsense understanding of the physical and social world is constructed during early childhood by investigating 1) how children infer the concepts and causal relations that enable them to engage in accurate prediction, explanation, and intervention; 2) the factors that support curiosity and exploration, allowing children to engage in effective discovery and 3) how these abilities inform and interact with social cognition to support intuitive theories of the self and others.</td>

      <td><b><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/">Yejin Choi</a></b> is an Associate Professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and also a senior research manager at AI2 overseeing the project Mosaic. Her recent research focus on commonsense knowledge and reasoning, neural language generation, and language grounding with vision. She was a recepient of Borg Early Career Award (BECA) in 2018, among the IEEE’s AI Top 10 to Watch in 2015, a co-recipient of the Marr Prize at ICCV 2013, and a faculty advisor for the Sounding Board team that won the inaugural Alexa Prize Challenge in 2017.  </td>

      <td><b><a href="http://alisongopnik.com/">Alison Gopnik</a></b> is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley.  She is a world leader in cognitive science, particularly the study of children’s learning and development. Alison is especially interested in how children learn about the causal structure of the world—how some things make other things happen. Her lab explores how children learn by observing statistical patterns, doing experiments and watching the experiments of others.</td>
